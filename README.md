# Event Aggregator
This application was an attempt of building of web service similar to MeetUp.

## What's in?
MVC web application built with Java, SpringBoot, Hibernate, ThymeLeaf

## What have I learned?
Working on this project gave me an insight on how client-server web applications work.
I've explored the path of creating a simple REST-API from scratch and chained it with GUI.
The data computed by this application was being stored in MySQL database, therefore I had to
understand the basic concepts of SQL and relational databases.
